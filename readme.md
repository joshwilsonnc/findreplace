<p>Drupal 7 Find and Replace</p>

<p>There are a few similar modules available in the Drupal projects space but I have found them to be 
unreliable in performance or even stability, so this is a basic version that gets the job done.</p>

<p><strong><em>Still very much in beta. Use with caution: back up your database prior to 
installing, or for galaxy&#8217;s sake, running an actual find-and-replace.</em> This module works
for me but it has not been rigorously tested.</strong></p>

<p>Searches only node bodies (all content types) at present. Working on support for 
user specification of content types &amp; fields.</p>

<p>Basic string find-and-replace works fine in my limited testing.
Regex find-and-replace behaving inconsistently - working on this.</p>

<p>To-dos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support and admin options for find/replacing over user-specified content types 
and fields</li>
<li>Improve regex find/replace - currently behaving inconsistently</li>
<li>Complete documentation</li>
<li>testing, testing, testing</li>
</ul>
