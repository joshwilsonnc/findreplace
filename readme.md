<p>Drupal 7 Find and Replace</p>

<p>There are a few similar modules available in the Drupal projects space but I have found them to be 
unreliable in performance or even stability, so this is a basic version that does what I needed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Still very much in beta. Use with caution: back up your database prior to 
installing, or for galaxy&#8217;s sake, running an actual find-and-replace.</em></strong></p>

<p>Searches only node bodies at present. Working on admin options for content types &amp; fields.</p>

<p>Basic string find-and-replace works fine in my limited testing.
Regex find-and-replace behaving inconsistently - working on this.</p>
